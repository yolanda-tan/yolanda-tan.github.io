<h1 class="header1_box">Here are some cool things I've made:</h1>

<p>I get inspired from my daily life, activities I do a lot, or things I am passionate about. </p>

<h2>Croquette</h2>
<p>Croquette is an application that converts user inputted images into pixel grids to help streamline the process of crochet tapestries. I'm most proud of employing a colour quantization algorithm to help minimize the colours a user will need for any image. I first wrote this program in Python and am now working on writing in Javascript to improve my web development skills.</p>

<h2>WaveGen</h2>
<p>WaveGen is an analysis of wave energy generation in the port of Vancouver. The goal was to see if boat traffic had any impact on electricity generation. This was accomplished through using a MATLAB simulation to test two different wave energy converter models. It was challenging to use MATLAB for the first time, as well as process a large(ish) dataset of over 1200 points.</p>
