<h1 class="h1_box">Here are some cool things I've made:</h1>

<p>My inspiration comes from my daily life, activities I enjoy, or things I am passionate about. </p>

<h2>Croquette</h2>
<p>is an application that converts user inputted images into pixel grids to help streamline the process of crochet tapestries. I'm most proud of employing a colour quantization algorithm to help minimize the colours a user will need for any image. I first wrote this program in Python and am now working on writing in Javascript to improve my web development skills.</p>

<h2>WaveGen</h2>
<p>is an analysis of wave energy generation in the port of Vancouver. The goal was to see if boat traffic had any impact on electricity generation. This was accomplished through using a MATLAB simulation to test two different wave energy converter models. It was challenging to use MATLAB for the first time, as well as process a large(ish) dataset of over 1200 points.</p>

<h2>...this website!</h2>
<p> I created this website to not only showcase my skills and projects, but as a way for people to get to know me! It has also motivated me to keep developing my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
