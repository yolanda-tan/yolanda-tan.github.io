<h1 class="h1_box">Here are some cool things I've made:</h1>

<p>My inspiration comes from my daily life, activities I enjoy, or things I am passionate about. I've also included some projects for classes.</p>

    <h2>Absolute Unit</h2>
    <div class="flex start_left flex_gap">
    <p class="small">is a 3D puzzle designed in collaboration with my teammates for my SYDE101L class, following the theme of Canadian animals and culture. Fat Bear Week, an online event where people vote for the bear they think is the fattest and most hiberation ready, inspired our concept. To fit this theme, we included representations of a bear's diet.</p>

    <p>We 3D modelled the puzzle with SolidWorks and designed a manual and presentation to go with it. I was specifically responsible for 3D modelling the legs and crafting the <a href="/documents/absolute_unit_manual.pdf" target="_blank" class="link1">manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Croquette</h2>
<p>is an application that converts user inputted images into pixel grids to help streamline the process of crochet tapestries. I'm most proud of employing a colour quantization algorithm to help minimize the colours a user will need for any image. I first wrote this program in Python and am now working on writing in Javascript to improve my web development skills.</p>

<h2>WaveGen</h2>
<p>is an analysis of wave energy generation in the port of Vancouver. The goal was to see if boat traffic had any impact on electricity generation. This was accomplished through using a MATLAB simulation to test two different wave energy converter models. It was challenging to use MATLAB for the first time, as well as process a large(ish) dataset of over 1200 points.</p>

<h2>...this website!</h2>
<p> I created this website to not only showcase my skills and projects, but as a way for people to get to know me! It has also motivated me to keep developing my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>
