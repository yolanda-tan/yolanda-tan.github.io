<h2>I love to...</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li class="list_s1">hang out with my cat, Squid. He loves to play with hair ties and scream for food. Even though Squid pretends he's carefully guarding the house, I know he's actually just snoozing in the sun.</li>
    <div class="vspace_mini"></div>
    <li class="list_s2">work on my crochet projects. Having something to do with my hands helps me focus and I even get something functional out of it in the end. I've made bags, sweaters, and plushies and I'm always on the lookout for new inspiration! </li>
    <div class="vspace_mini"></div>
    <li class="list_s3">play video games. Some of my favourite games are Celeste, Untitled Goose Game, and Hades. I also want to recognize that I may have an (un)healthy addiction to gacha games... </li>
