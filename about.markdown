<h1 class="header1_box">Let me introduce myself:</h1>

<h2>I'm Yolanda.</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td style="width:50%">I'm going into my second year in the Honours Systems Design Engineering with Co-op program at the University of Waterloo. </td>

<h2>I'm interested in</h2>
<p>neuroscience research utilising brain imaging, modelling, and signal processing. Specifically, I want to learn more about performing simulations with computer models, helping make them more efficient and accurate. </p>

<h2>A big part of my life</h2>
<p>is figure skating. I started in singles skating when I was three, competing up to the novice level. I then transitioned to synchronized skating, where represented Canada internatioanlly on Team Nova Junior. I am also a Skate Canada Certified Canskate Coach and am working towards my regional certification. </p>

<h2>I love to...</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>hang out with my cat, Squid. He loves to play with hair ties and scream for food. Even though Squid pretends he's carefully guarding the house, I know he's actually just snoozing in the sun.</li>
    <li>work on my crochet projects. Having something to do with my hands helps me focus and I even get something functional out of it in the end. I've made bags, sweaters, and plushies and I'm always on the lookout for new inspiration! </li>
    <li>play video games. Some of my favourite games are Celeste, Untitled Goose Game, and Hades. I also want to recognize that I may have an (un)healthy addiction to gacha games... </li>
    </ul>
